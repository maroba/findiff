- Includes standard operators from vector calculus like gradient, divergence and curl
- Can handle uniform and non-uniform grids
- Can handle arbitrary linear combinations of derivatives with constant and variable coefficients
- Fully vectorized for speed
- Calculate raw finite difference coefficients for any order and accuracy for uniform and non-uniform grids
- Generate matrix representations of arbitrary linear differential operators
- Solve partial differential equations with Dirichlet or Neumann boundary conditions
- Generate differential operators for arbitrary stencils
- _New in version 0.10:_ Symbolic representation of finite difference schemes
